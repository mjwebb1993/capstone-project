# capstone-project

Currently a work in progress, this README currently serves as an overview of the project and will updated as work on the project progresses.

### Overview
In short, my project will revolve around two core features that will respectively branch out to intertwine into one application. These two core features are a database users can upload their files/documents to and a forum where users can converse with other users about any document that they have access to on the database. The basic idea is to be able to allow groups of individuals to view these documents and be able to disucuss them in real time. Now while there are applications with similar functionalities, far too many applications have an insufficent means for users to talk among themselves, or the applications that do have branched out to implement an avalanche of features that drown out the simple purpose of this proposed project. This application will be able to give users a better experience as it will be more streamlined in its overall purpose as compared to other similar applications.
### Features
Key features will include users being able to:
- create and authenticate accounts
- be able to manage their documents through CRUD functionality
- search for documents by either title or "contains"
- users will be able to add other users to a group/list for easier access
